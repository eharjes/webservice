## The application features two channels

### First channel: Number guessing
- A game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100
- The user will receive feedback according to the last guess whether the target number is higher or lower than the guess
- This way the user can close in on the target number
- If the number is guessed correctly a new number will be chosen automatically and the user can just keep guessing without interruption

### Second channel: Hangman
- The user can play Hangman with a randomly chosen word out of 100
- The user will get feedback after each guess and lives will be deducted if the letter is not included
- If the user tries to guess more than one letter or a letter that was already guessed before he will receive an error and told what he did wrong
